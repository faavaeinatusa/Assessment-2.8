	The focus of this programme is one of citizenship and social awareness.</P>
	
	<p>The four days of activities in which your son/daughter will participate are as follows: Community Service in Tawa, Adrenalin Forest Confidence course and Pirates Cove Mini Golf (Same day), 
	Rangituhi Day Tramp, or Marlborough Sounds camping, kayaking and biking experience.</p>
	
	<p>These EOTC trips will run from Tuesday 4 December to Friday 7 December. All of the trips will depart from Tawa College at 8:35am and will return by 3:20pm. The total cost of the trips is $75.00 per student. 
	This includes transport and the cost of all activities. Due to the nature of the activities and the fixed costs involved, there will be no refunds given. 
	Students are expected to bring a packed lunch on all of these days as there will be limited opportunity to purchase food.</p></div></div>
